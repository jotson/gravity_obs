They struck without warning.

Diplomacy failed.

Fleet after fleet was sent to engage our new enemy.

But their technology is incredible.
They seem to have limitless reinforcements.

[wave amp=15 freq=9][color=#0095e9]But there is hope.[/color][/wave]

We have a new type of ship capable of
warping behind enemy lines and raiding their bases.

The mission is simple:
Warp in. Steal their reactor core. Get out.

Good luck, pilot.
